# Description of the Assessment Task

This is a group assignment where you will collaborate with one, two or three more students (up to **maximum of 5 in a group on special request**) in your class to produce a technical paper on Key Exchange Protocol attacks. A key exchange protocol is a method that generates a cryptographic key over a public and insecure medium such as the Internet. Diffie-Hellman (D-H) and RSA are two of the most widely used key exchange protocols. However, D-H and RSA are susceptible to specific attacks including, but not limited to, a man-in-the-middle attack and a timing attack, respectively.

In this coursework, you will:
1.  Explain one attack technique on D-H.
2.  Explain one attack technique on RSA.
3.  Implement D-H and RSA.
4.  Apply the attack techniques to attack D-H and RSA.
5.  Explain how to defend D-H and RSA from these attacks.
6.  Apply the defensive techniques to defend D-H and RSA.
7.  Compare and contrast the attacks on D-H and RSA.
8.  Compare and contrast the methods you applied to defend D-H and RSA from these attacks.

You should organise your technical paper as follows:
* Title of your paper, author names, affiliations and University of Aberdeen student ID.
* Abstract, maximum 150 words.
* Introduction section.
* Related work section.
* Methods section.
* Results section.
* Discussion section.
* Conclusion and future work section.
* Authors contribution section.

## Assessment Criteria

After completing this coursework, the student will be able to:
* Explain two attack methods on Diffie-Hellman and RSA.
* Explain two defensive techniques to protect Diffie-Hellman and RSA from these attacks.
* Implement the Diffie-Hellman and RSA key exchange protocols.
* Apply two attack methods on Diffie-Hellman and RSA.
* Apply two defensive techniques to protect Diffie-Hellman and RSA.
* Compare and contrast two attack methods on Diffie-Hellman and RSA.
* Compare and contrast two defensive methods for Diffie-Hellman and RSA.

## Technical paper

You will format your paper using the **IEEE conference proceedings style**, double-column page, **minimum 6 pages and maximum 8 pages**. All tables and figures must be labelled, captioned and included within the paper. The paper must be written in English and carefully read and agreed by all authors. References will be formatted using the IEEE referencing style. The references section and author contribution sections are excluded from the page limit. Save your paper as one PDF file, and submit the PDF file to the coursework submission page. Naming format for the technical paper: `"Group number"_"Paper title"`, e.g., `Group200_ILoveRSA`.

## Code

You can use any programming language such as **Java, Python or C++** to implement D-H and RSA, implement the attacks on D-H and RSA, and implement the defensive methods to protect D-H and RSA from the attacks you implemented. Put all your code in **one ZIP file** and submit the ZIP file to the coursework submission page. Naming format for the code file: `"Group number"_"Paper title"_code`, e.g., `Group200_ILoveRSA_code`.
